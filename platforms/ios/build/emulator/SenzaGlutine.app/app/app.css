/*
In NativeScript, the app.css file is where you place CSS rules that
you would like to apply to your entire application. Check out
http://docs.nativescript.org/ui/styling for a full list of the CSS
selectors and properties you can use to style UI components.

/*
In many cases you may want to use the NativeScript core theme instead
of writing your own CSS rules. For a full list of class names in the theme
refer to http://docs.nativescript.org/ui/theme.
